# AI-sentiment-prod
Production ready AI 

The app folder contains the docker-compose version of this app (https://github.com/hr23232323/nlp_medium_p2). This folder can 
be used to build the docker images that I then go and use when deploying to k8s you dont need it unless I have removed the 
docker images(from Docker hub) and you need to build them again.

Go to the Terraform-eks folder for instructions to build this app on a k8's cluster.
